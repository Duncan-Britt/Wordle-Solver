### Building

To build, run `./build.sh` from your terminal. This will produce an the executable `app` which can be run with `./app`. If you can not execute `build.sh`, enter chmod +x ./build.sh` in your terminal and then try.

Note to self, in Emacs, use eval-expression: (setq-default c-basic-offset 2) to set the auto indent level to two spaces for this project.
